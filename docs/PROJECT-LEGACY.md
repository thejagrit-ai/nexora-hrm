# EMP Cloud Ecosystem — Project Progress

## Last Updated: 2026-03-23

## Overview
EMP Cloud is a comprehensive HRMS ecosystem with a central platform (EMP Cloud) and modular add-ons. Each module is a separate repo with its own database, server, and client — connected via OAuth2/OIDC SSO.

---

## Architecture Decisions

- **EMP Cloud = Core HRMS** — not a separate module. Attendance, leave, profiles, docs, announcements, policies are built into the platform. Free with subscription.
- **EMP Billing = Internal billing engine** — handles subscription billing for EMP Cloud. NOT a sellable module. NOT in the marketplace.
- **EMP Attendance = Part of Core HRMS** — NOT a separate module. Built into EMP Cloud.
- **EMP Field & EMP Biometrics = Already built** by another team. Not in our build scope.
- **EMP Projects = Already built** by another team. Not in our build scope.
- **9 sellable modules** in the marketplace: Payroll, Monitor, Recruit, Field, Biometrics, Projects, Rewards, Performance, Exit

## SSO Flow
EMP Cloud dashboard → user clicks "Launch" on a module → URL opens with `?sso_token=<JWT>` → module's client extracts token → calls `POST /auth/sso` → server decodes EMP Cloud RS256 JWT, validates user in empcloud DB, issues module-specific HS256 JWT → user is auto-authenticated.

## Working Rules
- Never start building without explicit user confirmation on the plan
- Always show plans/READMEs before executing
- Always deploy to ngrok before asking user to test
- Never commit .pem, .key, .env files — always verify .gitignore
- Never use `git add .` — add specific files by name
- User only tests via ngrok URLs
- Always add screenshots to README.md with markdown image references before pushing to remote — screenshots in the repo but not in the README are invisible to the team

### Known issues:
- Ngrok free tier tunnel timeouts — use paid plan or deploy to cloud for stable URLs
- Some E2E tests tolerate 500s due to missing DB columns — noted in test results, non-blocking

### Next session priorities:
1. Production deployment (use docker-compose.prod.yml)
2. Custom domain setup (empcloud.com subdomains)
3. SSL certificates
4. Database backups
5. Monitoring & alerting
6. Load testing
