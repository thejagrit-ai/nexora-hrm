// JOB-BOARD PUBLISH CONNECTORS  —  scaffold (stubbed)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The outbound counterpart to the candidate-source connectors: publish a job
// posting OUT to an external board. Publishing to Naukri / LinkedIn / Apna /
// Indeed is credentialed and ToS-restricted — there is no universal "post
// everywhere" API — so every connector here is a STUB. A stub records the
// operator's intent (a job_publications row) but never actually posts; it
// reports what real setup each board needs. This keeps the framework honest:
// it never claims a job was published to a board it cannot reach.
//
// To make a board go live later, replace its `publish()` body with the board's
// real feed generation (Indeed/LinkedIn crawl an XML feed) or employer API call
// (Naukri/Apna), gated on board_publish_settings.credentials_configured.
