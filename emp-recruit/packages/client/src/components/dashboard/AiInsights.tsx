/**
 * AiInsights — the dashboard's insight card.
 *
 * The server sends a KIND and its VALUES, never a finished sentence, so every
 * line here is written by the app's own i18n files and reads in whichever of the
 * six languages the user has selected. That is the whole reason the endpoint
 * doesn't just return prose.
 *
 * The insights are rule-derived rather than model-generated — see the comment on
 * getInsights() in analytics.service.ts for why. Each is a threshold or ranking
 * over data the analytics endpoints already compute, so none of these sentences
 * can contain a number that isn't in the database.
 *
 * The card renders NOTHING when there are no insights, rather than an empty
 * shell announcing it has nothing to say. A new org with three applications
 * genuinely has no findings worth a card.
 *
 * Tone colours the bullet, but never carries meaning by itself: every item is a
 * full sentence, so the colour is emphasis only. The dots use 500-level steps
 * because those pass through unchanged in dark mode — the remaps in globals.css
 * only cover the 50/100 tints, which would vanish against the dark surface.
