-- BACKFILL: org_subscriptions.price_per_seat → effective per-cycle
--
-- Before this migration day, EmpCloud stored price_per_seat as the MONTHLY
-- base. After the dynamic-pricing rewrite, price_per_seat means the
-- effective per-seat per-cycle amount the customer agreed to. For
-- subscriptions created BEFORE the deploy, the stored value is the old
-- monthly base; emp-billing now treats whatever EmpCloud sends as
-- per-cycle, so quarterly subs would be charged 1/3 of the right amount
-- and annual subs 1/12. Run this once after the deploy to heal them.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES
--   For every active / trial / suspended / past_due subscription:
--     1. Resolve the matching plan_pricing row for the sub's
--        (plan_tier, currency, seat band, effective date).
--     2. Resolve the cycle's discount and (currency-matched) override.
--     3. Compute the effective per-cycle price using the same rules the
--        live code uses (override_amount_per_seat if currency matches,
--        otherwise monthly_base × (1 - discount_pct/100) × months_in_cycle).
--     4. UPDATE price_per_seat to the new value if it differs.
--   Cancelled / expired subscriptions are LEFT ALONE.
--
-- DESIGN
--   This is a two-pass pattern:
--     - Pass 1 (a temp preview table) shows every row that WOULD change
--       and the before/after numbers. Inspect this carefully before
--       committing the UPDATE.
--     - Pass 2 (the UPDATE) writes the new prices in a single statement.
--   Wrapped in a transaction. ROLLBACK; until you've eyeballed the
--   preview, then COMMIT;.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT
--   Re-running with no changes is a no-op (UPDATE sees no diff). Safe to
--   re-run if the preview SELECT exposes a row you want to ignore --
--   just narrow the WHERE clause in the UPDATE.
